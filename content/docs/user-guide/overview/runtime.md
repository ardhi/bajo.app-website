Bajo should run perfectly fine on Node.js version 20 or higher. Using the latest stable runtime is recommended. Bajo-based apps are also known to run with Bun without any problems.

Bajo is a pure ES6 framework that utilizes dynamic imports **a lot**. Running on a system with a fast disk (e.g., SSD) and enough RAM is highly recommended, especially when you load a lot of plugins.
